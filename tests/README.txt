1. Files in tests directory:

  * converstion_test.py
    -This file contains all of the necessary tests
     for the backend to make sure that both
     conversion files work correctly. These files 
     can be found in the mongo directory.
        + To use this you would simply move 
	  the conversion_test file to the same
	  location as the measurement files
	  and type:
	  	pytest
