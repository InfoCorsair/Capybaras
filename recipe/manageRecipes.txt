//Brendan My list of ideas

1. Change the name of the navbar button from Export to Upload/Download Recipes //Complete

3. add a toggle list function in exportImport.html //Works
4. add a toggle list function in ingredients.html //Works
6. add a toggle list funciton in recipe.html //Works
9. Implement Upload Form inside exportImport.html file //works
9. Use href to direct to file location in Capybaras to then fetch and download file.//

What is the goal: I want to be able to click browse and be able to click a file to choose from and download it. I want to be able to click browse and select a file to upload it to the database.
